This project was created by the Quire Community Manager, Erin Cecele Dunigan, with the intention of giving community members hands-on experience with both [GitHub](http://github.com) and [Quire](http://quire.getty.edu). 

*Cute Critters* is a collection of the pets (or favorite animals) of Quire community members. Please see the ["How to Contribute to This Publication"](/add-your-pet/) section of this publication to learn how to add your own cute critter to this delightful collection.
